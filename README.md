# PROMPTING_APPLICATION
A simple Hugging Face Space that demonstrates prompt engineering basics using a user-friendly interface. Built to test and explore prompt design strategies with a generative AI model.
Here's a professional and detailed `README.md` file for your GitHub project, incorporating all the resources you mentioned (including the Hugging Face link, strategies from both whitepapers, and Kaggle codelabs):

# 🌟 Prompt Engineering Project — GenAI Intensive (Day 1)

Welcome to my project repository for **Day 1 of the Google Gen AI Intensive Course (Q1 2025 Cohort)**. This project demonstrates key strategies from foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) and Prompt Engineering, integrating insights from official Google whitepapers, podcasts, and hands-on Kaggle codelabs.

🚀 **Live Demo:**

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is the outcome of **Day 1: Prompting** strategies from the GenAI Intensive program. It combines foundational knowledge, prompt engineering techniques, and hands-on coding in a single space. This project showcases how prompt design can impact the quality, safety, and reliability of LLM outputs.

## 🧠 Core Strategies from Foundational LLMs

Based on the whitepaper [_"Foundational Large Language Models & Text Generation"_](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-foundational-llm-and-text-generation), the key strategies explored are:

### 1. **Understanding LLMs**
- Trained on massive corpora with billions of parameters
- Generate human-like text via next-token prediction
- Perform few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot learning

### 2. **Capabilities**
- Text summarization, translation, classification, sentiment analysis, question answering, and more
- Emergent abilities like reasoning, multi-step thinking

### 3. **Limitations**
- Hallucinations (confident but wrong answers)
- Biases and fairness concerns
- Limited context window

### 4. **Design Principles**
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Context formatting for improved comprehension

## ✨ Prompt Engineering Strategies

Based on the [_"Prompt Engineering"_ whitepaper_](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-prompt-engineering) and GenAI Unit 1, I explored the following techniques:

### ✅ **Prompting Strategies Covered:**
- **Zero-shot prompting**: Directly querying the model without examples
- **Few-shot prompting**: Including examples in the prompt for better generalization
- **Instruction-based prompting**: Explicitly guiding model behavior
- **Chain-of-thought prompting**: Breaking complex reasoning into steps
- **Structured output prompting**: Asking for JSON or tabular output formats

### 🎯 Goals:
- Improve **output accuracy**
- Ensure **clarity of intent**
- Mitigate **hallucinations** and **biases**
- Enhance **reproducibility** and **evaluation**
